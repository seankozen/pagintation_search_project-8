# SQL Library Manager
This app uses a database to store information about books in a library.  The user can add new books, update books, and delete books.  The app uses Node.js, Express.js, Pug, Sequelize, and SQLite.  

## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.
- I built this app based on mockup images.
## How to navigate this project
- The application connects to a Postgres database on Heroku.
- Migrations had to be set up for the app to connect correctly to the 
  database: [https://github.com/seankozen/pagintation_search_project-8/blob/master/migrations/20211128160628-create-book.js]
- Uses Sequelize for database connectivity: [https://github.com/seankozen/pagintation_search_project-8/tree/master/models]
## Why I built the project this way
- My plan is to become a full-stack developer, and this was the first database connection, use of Node.js, and Express.js.
## If I had more time I would change this
- Use React.js to creat the app.
## Available Scripts
npm start
